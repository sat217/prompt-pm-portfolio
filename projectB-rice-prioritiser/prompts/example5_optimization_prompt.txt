# Example 5 — Prompt Optimization Task

The user's original prompt:
"Write me a report on finance."

Your tasks:
1. Rewrite the prompt into a high-quality, optimized version that is:
   - Specific
   - Structured
   - Includes constraints
   - Defines tone and length
   - Includes a checklist or evaluation criteria

2. Then write a short explanation (4–5 sentences) describing WHY your optimized prompt is better.
   Focus on clarity, structure, constraints, user intent, and outcome quality.
