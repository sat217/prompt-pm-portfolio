# RICE Prioritiser — AI-Powered Backlog Normalisation & Scoring

This project converts messy product backlog items into structured **RICE scores** using AI.
It demonstrates strong practical prompt engineering skills including system design, few-shot prompting, 
role prompting, reasoning control, evaluation prompts, and optimisation.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Product teams often store backlog notes in unstructured, inconsistent formats.  
This project uses a carefully engineered prompt system to:

- Extract features from messy notes  
- Assign Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort  
- Normalise effort values  
- Calculate RICE score  
- Output final prioritised backlog in JSON  

The project includes:
- A robust system prompt  
- Instruction prompt  
- High-quality few-shot examples  
- 6 advanced prompt engineering exercises  
- A Jupyter notebook for testing and demonstrating results

## 🧠 Prompt Engineering Techniques Demonstrated

### 1. **System Prompting**
Defines behaviour, tone, safety rules, and output structure.

### 2. **Instruction Prompting**
Gives exact task-level guidelines, constraints, and formatting expectations.

### 3. **Few-Shot Prompting**
Shows the model how raw backlog text maps to structured RICE output.

### 4. **Role-Based Prompting**
Teaches the model to respond as a domain expert.

### 5. **Reasoning Control**
Internal chain-of-thought prompting (CoT suppressed in output).

### 6. **Prompt Optimisation**
Improving user prompts for clarity, constraints, and quality.

### 7. **Evaluation Prompting**
AI performance scoring based on accuracy, completeness, clarity, safety.

## 🧪 Running the Notebook

The Jupyter notebook (`notebook/main.ipynb`) loads all prompts and runs them against LLMs.  
It generates real outputs, proving your prompts work.

This is the piece hiring managers love.
