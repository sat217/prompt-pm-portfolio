🛣️ Driver Trip Tracking — AI-Augmented PM Workflow

A real-world project demonstrating how AI can transform ambiguous field data into structured, actionable project information.

This system takes messy driver trip logs (voice notes, text dumps, shorthand updates) and converts them into a clean, structured trip report — ready for dashboards, task planning, and operations optimization.

This project showcases:

Prompt engineering

PM workflow design

Data structuring

AI-assisted requirement extraction

Practical business use cases

📌 Problem Statement

Transportation teams often receive updates in inconsistent formats:

Drivers send WhatsApp voice notes

Field staff send scattered text messages

Trip details are incomplete or unclear

PMs waste time manually interpreting and documenting data

This leads to:

Poor visibility

Errors in billing

Miscommunication

Missing trip metadata

Slow reporting

🎯 Objective

Create an AI-powered workflow that:

Converts unstructured driver input → structured JSON

Identifies missing details

Estimates unclear values

Standardizes trip format

Produces clean outputs for dashboards or downstream tools
